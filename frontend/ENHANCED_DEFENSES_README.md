## 🛡️ Enhanced Defense Types

### **Statute of Limitations Defense (90-95% strength)**

Now includes:
```
## Why This Defense Works

Based on your last payment being Over 6 years ago, this debt has aged
beyond the legal collection period in most jurisdictions.

### Legal Background
- Most states impose a 3-6 year statute of limitations on debt collection actions
- The clock typically starts from the date of last payment or last account activity
- Once expired, the debt becomes "time-barred" and legally unenforceable
- Creditors cannot win a lawsuit on time-barred debt if properly asserted

### Your Specific Situation
- Last Payment: Over 6 years ago (approximately 7 years ago)
- Likely Statute Period: 4-6 years (varies by state)
- Current Status: Debt appears time-barred
- Success Likelihood: 95% - This is a VERY STRONG defense

### What Happens If Successful
- Case dismissed entirely
- No judgment against you
- No wage garnishment or bank levies
- Clean resolution without payment
```

Plus:
- **Exact language to use in your Answer**
- **Discovery requests to prove the debt is time-barred**
- **Winning scenarios** (6 specific situations)
- **Risks to avoid** (4 critical mistakes)

### **Lack of Standing Defense (60-90% strength)**

Enhanced with:
```
## Why This Defense Works

The plaintiff must prove they have legal standing to sue you - meaning
they must show they actually own the debt and have the right to collect it.

### Issues Identified
1. Plaintiff is a debt buyer, not the original creditor
2. Defendant does not recognize plaintiff as creditor
3. No original contract attached to complaint

### Legal Requirements for Standing
To have standing, the plaintiff MUST prove:
1. Ownership: They currently own the debt
2. Chain of Title: Complete paper trail showing how debt was transferred
3. Original Agreement: Terms of the original contract
4. Assignment: Valid transfer from original creditor (if debt was sold)

### Strategic Advantage
Many debt buyers purchase debts in bulk for pennies on the dollar WITHOUT
receiving complete documentation. They gamble that defendants won't challenge
standing. When challenged, they often cannot meet the burden of proof.
```

Plus:
- **6 specific discovery requests** to demand proof
- **Answer language** denying standing
- **Motion to dismiss** template
- **6 winning scenarios**
- **4 risks to avoid**
- **4 case law support points**
